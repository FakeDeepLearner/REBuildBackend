TODO: Start implementing websockets, in order to implement live collaboration with multiple users.

TODO(priority 2): Before fully implementing websockets, write an extensive test suite

TODO(ASAP) Use the newly created like tables to create methods to like comments and posts
(and set up batch processing infrastructure)

TODO (priority 1): Fully change authentication to session based authentication instead of jwt's in order for
better integration with spring security. The other mechanisms will still use jwt tokens.

TODO: Change the mechanisms to obtain, and "store" the refresh tokens; and reimplement the "remember me" feature

TODO (might not happen): Change the forum credential
updating process to mimic (more or less) the ones with the other app credentials

TODO(might not happen): Set up the ability for the frontend to unload the comments when they leave the viewport,
by providing api functions that it can call with the index. Set up prefetching
and caching the next set of comments to be shown to increase performance
