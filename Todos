TODO: Start implementing websockets, in order to implement live collaboration with multiple users.


TODO: Before fully implementing websockets, write an extensive test suite

TODO(priority 1): Refactor all service methods that use catch DataIntegrityViolationPattern to something similar to the new create user method

TODO(priority 1, hand in hand with the above): Refactor the database access methods to manually rollback the transaction in memory (tne database will take care of rolling it back in the actual database)

TODO (priority 2): Fully change authentication to session based authentication instead of jwt's in order for better integration with spring security. The other mechanisms will still use jwt tokens.

TODO (might not happen): Change the forum credential updating process to mimic (more or less) the ones with the other app credentials
